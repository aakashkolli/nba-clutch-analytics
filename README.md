## 🎯 What is "Clutch" Performance?

**Clutch games** are defined as games decided by **5 points or fewer** - the high-pressure moments where true champions emerge. This dashboard goes beyond traditional box scores to reveal:

- Which players **elevate** their game under pressure
- Which players **struggle** when it matters most
- How **team dynamics** change in close games
- **Predictive insights** for future clutch performance

## 📊 Data Sources & Methodology

### **Dataset Overview**
- **Games**: ~65,000 NBA games with scores and metadata
- **Game Details**: ~1.3M player-game records with detailed statistics
- **Teams**: Franchise information and naming
- **Time Period**: Multiple NBA seasons with comprehensive coverage

### **Clutch Definition**
```python
# A game is considered "clutch" if:
games['IS_CLUTCH_GAME'] = (games['SCORE_DIFF'] <= 5) & (games['SCORE_DIFF'] >= 0)
```

### **CPI Calculation (Clutch Player Index)**

Our proprietary **Clutch Player Index** uses an advanced ensemble approach:

#### **For High-Volume Players (≥5 clutch games):**
- **Z-score normalization** across all qualified players
- **Weighted composite** of key performance metrics:
  - Points per game (30%)
  - Field goal percentage (25%)
  - Assists per game (15%)
  - Plus/minus per game (15%)
  - Turnovers per game (-15%, penalty)

#### **For Low-Volume Players (<5 clutch games):**
- **Min-max normalization** within low-volume cohort
- **Games-played scaling factor** to account for sample size
- **Baseline score minimum** to ensure meaningful rankings

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

### **Architecture: Advanced Ensemble**

Our predictive model uses a **3-model ensemble** optimized for clutch performance prediction:

| Model | Weight | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Random Forest** | 50% | Non-linear patterns, feature interactions |
| **Gradient Boosting** | 30% | Sequential learning, bias reduction |
| **Ridge Regression** | 20% | Linear baseline, regularization |

### **Enhanced Feature Engineering (21 Features)**

- **Base Statistics**: PPG, FG%, 3P%, AST/TO ratio, +/-
- **Rolling Averages**: 2-year stability metrics
- **Interaction Features**: PPG×FG%, clutch volume, consistency
- **Experience Tracking**: Years since debut (age proxy)
- **Performance Stability**: Coefficient of variation

### **Model Performance**

- **Training R²**: 0.502
- **Testing R²**: 0.337
- **MAE**: 0.250
- **RMSE**: 0.316

## 📖 Usage Examples

### **Finding Clutch Performers**
```python
# Top clutch players with minimum 10 games
top_clutch = player_df[player_df['GP_clutch'] >= 10].nlargest(10, 'CPI')
```

### **Comparing Players**
```python
# Head-to-head clutch performance
player1_clutch = player_df[player_df['PLAYER_NAME'] == 'LeBron James']
player2_clutch = player_df[player_df['PLAYER_NAME'] == 'Stephen Curry']
```

### **Team Analysis**
```python
# Team clutch win rates
team_clutch_rate = team_df['WIN_PCT_clutch'].sort_values(ascending=False)
```
